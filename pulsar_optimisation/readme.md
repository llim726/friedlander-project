# Pulsar Optimisation Code #

This folder contains code used in the Pulsar Optimisation study as a part of the Friedlander Project running at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute.
Files include Pythonic versions of Openim-OpenSense API functions. These Pythonic versions export errors/data as variables rather than writing to files. 
Also included are optimisation code which finds the best rotation of an experimental IMU/Quarternion-position output motion capture device that matches 
a model IMU-brick on a generic full-body OpenSim-OpenSense model.
